                        NFT is a unique token, it is like a digital entry in the blockchain registry that gives you the

                        NFT is a type of cryptographic token, each copy of which is unique and cannot be exchanged or
                        replaced by another similar token, although tokens are usually fungible in nature. Each NFT is
                        unique and exists in a single copy, it cannot be divided, and all information about its author,
                        buyer and all transactions with it is securely stored in the blockchain. In other words, an NFT
                        is a digital certificate attached to a unique object. As is the case with any asset, the price
                        of an NFT token for a certain object changes over time, and you may well invest - invest your
                        money in a project at the bottom of the market and sell at the top, thereby earning on the price
                        difference. And we will do our best to help you with this.
